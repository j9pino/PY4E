# PY4E Solutions
These are my solutions to the exercises from  the Coursera series, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody Specialization</a>. I may include additional practice from Dr. Severance's book, <a href="https://www.py4e.com/">Python for Everybody (2009),</a> later on.

If you come across this repository, please feel free to look at my files for guidance, but do not consider them the only "right" solution to any problem. I encourage you to be creative and learn the material to the best of your abilities.
